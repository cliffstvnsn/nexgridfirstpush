# Nexgrid Website 

# Nexgrid is a local smartgrid utility company here in my hometown Richmond, Virginia 

## I made this website as an improvement upon Nexgrid's current website which was published in 2010 and still being used as their active webpage

## for technology I chose to use HTML/CSS and JavaScript with Bootstrap and JQuery. 

## When I learned to code, I sort of jumped straight into React. It's not that I didn't know how to do anything in HTML/CSS (I actually started with this iteration of vanilla HTML/CSS and JS, then going on to learn Python and Flask which allows still more for writing real HTML), but most of the bigger, professional quality websites I have made were done in React frameworks. 

## So this is sort of a "back to basics" approach to web development!

## I went about this project this way to feel and see the implications of using just HTML/CSS to make a full, modern-looking and responsive website.

## I believe this will give me a renewed appreciation and understanding of React and why it is useful!

### I did not bother to modularize this application efficiently. I reused, copy-and-pasted a ton of code. It is probably nowhere near the most efficient structure for building a standard web-page of this size and scope. It could be done more efficiently. A website of this nature would be much better suited to being an Single-Page-Application (SPA) which React would facilitate easily. For example, the footer and navBar components could simply be dropped on every view, and just the body would have customizations. In this version, those components are copied for every single view, and every time you click something, the whole page re-renders. 

### This would perhaps be ideal if I was having to pass secure data or xml around the application, but since this website does not contain any vulnerable information (it's just a homepage for a company), it would be very well suited to being a Single-Page-Application.

### This has been a project that taught me a lot. As a front-end developer, I can pretty much YouTube or Google anything I don't know how to do, such as the creation of a Carousel, NavBar or professional-looking footer. 

### It's important to recognize that as developers, we shouldn't expect ourselves to memorize needless information that can be found online, and all of us do this. This is why interviews can be pretty stupid when we are expected to demonstrate knowledge on the spot, which is not the working condition of being on-the-job.

### I will probably recreate or do similar company websites like this in the future using React. Let me know if you have any suggestions or comments. Cheers
