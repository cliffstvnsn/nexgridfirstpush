                    Nexgrid builds products that provide utilities and consumers the ability to manage and monitor a
                    smart grid
                    or smart home network. These solutions utilize high speed, standards-based communications to provide
                    the
                    most reliable energy data communication networks that enable energy management and utility
                    operations in
                    real time. Nexgrid is a manufacturer and integrator of self-managing devices that offer utilities
                    unrestricted monitoring and control of metering and data for electric, water, and gas.

                    The ecoNet provides the foundation for providing real-time, secure management and monitoring of
                    meters and
                    intelligent end devices. It is the building block that enables utilities to deliver large amounts of
                    data
                    over a single standards-based platform. Through Nexgrid's commitment to innovation, its customers
                    are better
                    informed and able to manage their network in ways never possible before.
